Template literals or backticks(` `) //from es6 - can print variable and string together

==================23 Feb 2026 ===============
Synchronous:(Blocking): 
Async: means our program can start a task that takes time(like API calls ,file read, DB query)
        without blocking the rest of the code. So that program doen't wait and freez. it continue doing other work.
callback, promise, async/await: 
# Promise: in js is a way to handle the asynchronous operation
            represents a value that may be avoilable now, later or never.
            can be in one of 3 state:
                1.pending: operation still ongoing(initial state)
                2.fullfilled: operation completed successfully
                3.rejected: operation failed
    -Creating a promise and consuming a promise with .then() and .catch()
            fetch('https://fakestoreapi.com/products')
                .then(response => response.json())
                .then(data => console.log(data));



# async and await:
    aync make a function return a promise 
    await pause the execution inside an async function until the promise is resolved or rejected
    
    Live example: Payment system(payment gateways)

==================Node.js ==========
is a js runtime environment that allows us to run js outside the browser, mainly on server

Before Node.js:
-JS only worked inside browsers

After Node.js:
-Js can run on servers
-You can build APIs, backend systems and real-time application

#Node.js is build on: V8 engine- executes js
                            - open source high performance js and webassembly engine developed by google.
                            -compiles js directly into native machine code
                            - enabling fast execution in browser and other environments
                            - initially designed for google chrome, it now powers platforms like Node.js

#libuv: -asynchronous I/O operations and manages thread pool.


        -
         
        console.log("Start")
        setTimeout(()=>{
            console.log("Timer")   //libuv handles timer internally.
        }, 5000)
        console.log("end")

        Call Stack:
            console.log("Start") -> prints Start
            setTimeout -> sent to libuv
            console.log("End") -> prints End

            Timer finishes-> goes to CallBack Queue

            Event Loop checks -> Call Stack empty
            Push callback -> prints Timer

===== INternal working of sysnchronous operations=====

User Request --> Node Server --> V8 executes JS --> if Sync->Call Stack  -->libuv handles via: -Thread pool  --> Callback added to Queue  --> Event loop execcutes Callback
                                                    if async -> libuv                          -OS networking

Node.js mode it possible to:
-Use JavaScript for both frontend and backend

Local(Custom) modules:
We can create our own module and export function or variables
math.Js
app.js

#Core(built-in) Modules:
These come with Node.js. No installation needed


fs(File system)

========================== PATH MODULES ================
-work with file and directory path
#Absolute path & relative path 
-absolute path : complete path of a file 
                C:\Users\LENOVO\OneDrive\Desktop\Backend(training)\backend
-Reltive path : path according to the current working directory
                backend/app.js


backend/data(folder)/user.json
